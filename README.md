# Predicting COVID-19 hospitalization duration with Neural networks and Random forests

Project carried out in the scope of my Bachelor's Thesis. 

Files:
- Jupyter notebook ~ Code for generating the plots, creating, training and evaluating the models.
- PDF of my Bachelor's Thesis

For the main findings of the Exploratory Data analysis and an empirical comparison of the performance of Neural Networks in context of predicting the length of hospitalization please refer to the provided pdf.
